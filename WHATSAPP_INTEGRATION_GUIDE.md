## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **What Makes This Work**

The application embeds WhatsApp Web using an iframe:

```jsx
<iframe
    src="https://web.whatsapp.com/"
    title="WhatsApp Web"
    className="w-full h-full border-0"
    allow="camera; microphone; clipboard-read; clipboard-write; autoplay; encrypted-media; fullscreen"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-modals allow-downloads"
/>
```

This is the **exact same WhatsApp Web** you'd use if you visited `web.whatsapp.com` in your browser.

### **Security & Privacy**

- ✅ **End-to-end encrypted** (by WhatsApp)
- ✅ **Your data stays with WhatsApp** (we don't intercept anything)
- ✅ **Secure connection** (HTTPS)
- ✅ **Official WhatsApp Web** (not a third-party service)

---

## 🎯 **Customization Options**

### **Change Business Phone Number**

To use your own business WhatsApp number for Quick Chat:

1. Open `TransportAdminD.js`
2. Find these lines (around line 531, 545, 558, 576):
   ```jsx
   href={`https://wa.me/94771234567?text=...`}
   ```
3. Replace `94771234567` with your number:
   - Format: `[country code][phone number]`
   - No spaces, no special characters
   - Examples:
     - Sri Lanka: `94771234567`
     - USA: `12125551234`
     - UK: `447700900123`

### **Customize Messages**

Change the pre-written messages in the Quick Chat links:

```jsx
// Current message:
href={`https://wa.me/94771234567?text=${encodeURIComponent('Hello TripNest Support!')}`}

// Change to your message:
href={`https://wa.me/YOUR_NUMBER?text=${encodeURIComponent('Your custom message here')}`}
```
